        <h4>Will there be prizes?</h4>
        <p>
          Yes, there will be overall prizes as well as category prizes sponsored by companies split
          based on the type of contribution made. We encourage you to work on a project that
          interests you rather than aiming for a specific prize. Judging will be based on technical
          merit of the contribution, and not on flashiness or APIs used. Detailed prize information
          will be released closer to the event.
