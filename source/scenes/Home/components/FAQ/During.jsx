          All meals, snacks, and drinks will be provided for the entire weekend. If you have a

          variety of healthy food available throughout the weekend. If you’re at the event and there
          isn’t food available, let staff know and we’ll fix it immediately.

          ABSOLUTELY! We’ll be running a variety of mini-events this year, ranging from our historic
          Nerf battles to some brand new ideas we’ll be piloting this year. We’ll have a few
          keynotes and engaging workshops as well, so definitely familiarize yourself with our
          schedule before beginning work on your projects.
