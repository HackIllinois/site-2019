          You should bring a student ID, a change of clothing, personal items (toiletries), a laptop
          &amp; charger, and any required hardware for your hack. Due to power concerns, please do
          not bring extra monitors.

          Decisions will be released one month ahead of the event in January to allow time for
          hackers to make transportation plans. RSVP is required to check in, so be on the lookout
          for your acceptance email!

        <h4>How do I get there?</h4>
        <p>
          We will be providing buses from across the Midwest. Last year, we had buses from schools
          spanning the states of Illinois, Iowa, Wisconsin, Missouri, Indiana, and Ohio. Travel
          reimbursement may be provided in a limited form.

        <h4>Do I need a team?</h4>
        <p>
          You can work with up as many people as you want! Single person and pair teams are allowed,
          but we encourage you to work in a group. If you wish to form a team at HackIllinois, there
          will be events to pair potential team members.
