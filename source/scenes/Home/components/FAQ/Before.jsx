        <h4>How do applications work?</h4>
        <p>
          You must apply in order to be considered for HackIllinois. Admissions will be based on a
          weighted random lottery. Decisions will be released in early February in multiple waves,
          and it is to your advantage to apply as soon as possible. If youâ€™re accepted, there will
          be a limited time to RSVP before we reallocate your spot to another student, so be on the
          lookout for your acceptance email!

        <h4>How do I get there?</h4>
        <p>
          HackIllinois will have three bus routes this year! We will provide transportation to and
          from the event for University of Michigan &rarr; Michigan State, Purdue University, and
          Northwestern &rarr; DePaul &rarr; UIC &rarr; UChicago. If you do not attend one of these
          schools but would like to board at one of the stops, please send us an email to discuss.
          HackIllinois will not be providing travel reimbursement, including for driving or flying.

        <h4>Do I need a team?</h4>
        <p>
          Due to the nature of HackIllinois as an open source event, you are encouraged to work with
          others, including mentors, to contribute to open source projects. In particular, your
          contribution is required to have a license to be eligible for a prize. Mentors will be
          available on Slack before the event, as well at a project session on Friday. There are no
          team size limits, but most contributions end up coming from teams of around 6-8.

        <h4>What should I bring?</h4>
        <p>
          You should bring a student ID, a reusable water bottle, a change of clothing, personal
          items such as toiletries, and a laptop &amp; charger. Due to safety considerations, please
          do not bring desktop computers, extra monitors, weapons, or alcoholic beverages.
