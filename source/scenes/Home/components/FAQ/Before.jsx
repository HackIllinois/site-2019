          You should bring a student ID, a change of clothing, personal items (toiletries), a laptop
          &amp; charger, and any required hardware for your hack. Due to power concerns, please do
          not bring extra monitors.

        <p>
          Decisions will be released one month ahead of the event in January to allow time for
          hackers to make transportation plans. RSVP is required to check in, so be on the lookout
          for your acceptance email!

        <h4>How do I get there?</h4>
        <p>
          We will be providing buses for students this year to a number of universities! We will be
          announcing where they will be and finding bus coordinators from those schools periodically
          until February. If you are an industry mentor, we provide travel reimbursements. Inquire
          at <a href="mailto:opensource@hackillinois.org">opensource@hackillinois.org</a>.

        <h4>Do I need a team?</h4>
        <p>
          Single person and pair teams are allowed, but we encourage you to work in a group. You can
          work with as many people as you want, and if you wish to form a team at HackIllinois,
          there will be events to pair potential team members. Additionally this year, mentors will
          be on every team in order to qualify for prizes.
