        <h4>How do applications work?</h4>
        <p>
          You must apply in order to be considered for HackIllinois. Admissions will be based on a
          weighted random lottery. Decisions will be released in early February in two waves, and it
          is to your advantage to apply as soon as possible. If you’re accepted, there will be a
          limited time to RSVP before we reallocate your spot to another student, so be on the
          lookout for your acceptance email!

        <h4>How do I get there?</h4>
        <p>
          HackIllinois will be sending buses along 3 separate routes this year! We will provide
	        transportation from the University of Michigan and Michigan State, Purdue University, 
	        and Northwestern, DePaul, UIC, and UChicago.

        <h4>Do I need a team?</h4>
        <p>
          Due to the nature of HackIllinois as an open source event, you are encouraged to work with
          others to contribute to open source projects. In particular, you are required to work with
          a mentor in order to be eligible for a prize. Mentors will be available on Slack before
          the event, as well at a project session on Friday. There are no team size limits, but most
          contributions end up coming from teams of around 6-8.

        <h4>What should I bring?</h4>
        <p>
          You should bring a student ID, a reusable water bottle, a change of clothing, personal
          items such as toiletries, and a laptop &amp; charger. Due to safety considerations, please
          do not bring desktop computers, extra monitors, weapons, or alcoholic beverages.
